## Introduction

This repository serves as a resource for students who participated in the CE1115 Data Science course in 2021, specifically for the mini-project on creating a Movie Recommendation System. Here, you will find code and data related to the project.

## Project Overview

Our mini-project focuses on the development of a Movie Recommendation System. The primary goals of this project are as follows:

- **Data Collection:** We have collected movie data from TMDB (The Movie Database) to create a dataset for our recommendation system.

- **Recommendation Algorithms:** We have implemented recommendation algorithms, including collaborative filtering and content-based filtering, to provide movie recommendations.

## Usage

You are welcome to explore this repository to gain insights into the creation of a Movie Recommendation System. However, please keep in mind the following:

- **Outdated Content:** The content in this repository is based on the 2021 course. Validate any information or code with your current course materials, as there may have been updates or changes.

- **Educational Use:** This repository is intended for educational purposes. Feel free to use the code and data to enhance your understanding of Data Science concepts and Movie Recommendation Systems.
